# 3D Printing

Choose the lids you want to print depending on the buttons/controls you want to use, see [all available lids here](../Lids.md).

You can find the stls for all models in the `stls/` folder or get the print profile with [all lids and bins on makerworld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1834693-buttfinity-smart-gridfinity-buttons). 

You need one special bin for your microcontroller (a 1x1x5 bin with a special cutout for the microcontroller to snap into, currently there are bins for the ESP32 D1 mini, ESP8266 D1 mini and RP2040 Zero Mini), all other bins are basically normal 1x1x5 (or 2x1x5) gridfinity bins, just with some extra cutouts for the cables.

Print one of the microcontroller bins and then the same amount of other bins minus one as you have 1x1 lids (and print a 2x1x5 bin for every 2x1 lid you want).

You can optionally print a normal gridfinity baseplate if you want one or add magnets.

There are also optional plugs for the outside of your assembled module, that can be used to fill the holes in the bins.
