# Wiring

The idea is to solder pin headers to your microcontroller and buttons/sensors. 

All buttons/sensors and the microcontroller can then easily be connected and disconnected again with jumper cables.

As an alternative you can also solder jumper cables (ending in a female header) straight onto your buttons/sensors.
