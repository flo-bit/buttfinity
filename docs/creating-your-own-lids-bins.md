# Creating your own lids/bins

## Bins

If you have a microcontroller you want to use that doesn't yet have a bin, you can create your own by using the openscad base file `./models/bins/buttfinity-bin-base.scad`, simply add some cutouts for your microcontroller and export as stl (see `./models/bins/buttfinity-bin-esp32.scad` for an example).

## Lids

If you have a sensor or button you want to use that doesn't yet have a lid, you can create your own by using the openscad base file `./models/lids/lid-module.scad`, add some cutouts for your sensor or button and export as stl (see `./models/lids/switches/buttfinity-1x1-1-round-mx-switch-lid.scad` for an example).
