## Parts

> [!NOTE]  
> Amazon links are to the german amazon store and are not affiliate links, just where I bought the parts, I've tried to always use the most available parts, feel free to buy elsewhere. You can also use different microcontrollers, buttons/sensors, etc, see [Creating your own lids/bins](./docs/creating-your-own-lids-bins.md) for more information.

### Microcontroller

- ESP32 D1 Mini USB C [amazon](https://amazon.de/dp/B0CJNMRG37) (recommended version, lots of pins, works as a BLE keyboard)

- ESP8266 D1 Mini USB C [amazon](https://amazon.de/dp/B0D9W2WM2K) (cheaper version, less pins, DOES NOT work as a BLE keyboard, only for controlling your smart home with home assistant)

- RP2040 Zero Mini [amazon](https://amazon.de/gp/product/B0CNSQCV9Q) (no bluetooth or wifi but works as a HID usb device)

### Buttons/controls

> [!NOTE]  
> You don't need all of these, mix and match to your needs/preferences. If you have some other buttons/controls, feel free to [design your own lid](./docs/creating-your-own-lids-bins.md) (if you design something with a widely available part, a PR is welcome).
